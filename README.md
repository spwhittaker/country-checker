## Country Checker

Project using [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) API and React to view information about countries and test your knowledge of their flags and capitals. [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) used for styling.

I used [Vibrant](https://github.com/Vibrant-Colors/node-vibrant) in order to dynamically theme the information about the country using accent colours from its flag.
